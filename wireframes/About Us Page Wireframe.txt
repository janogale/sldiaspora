|  The Republic of Somaliland has a vibrant diaspora of over one       |
|  million people across the UK, Europe, North America, Middle East,   |
|  East Africa, and Australia.                                         |
|                                                                       |
|  Our diaspora contributes an estimated $1.3 billion annually in      |
|  remittances (45% of GDP), driving private sector growth through     |
|  investments in real estate, hospitality, education, healthcare,     |
|  and technology.                                                     |
